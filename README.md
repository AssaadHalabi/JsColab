Zero setup notebook based Javascript environment for fast prototyping, inspired by Google colab, but for Javascript and React. Can import any npm library dynamically. 


## Javscript and React Code Cells

Fully Featured Javascript notebook code cells for fast prototyping on the go and ability to import any npm library (or css library on npm such as bulma). Code cells support cumulative code execution similar to Google Colab. Use the built-in show function to preview your work. Syntax:

```show(literal | variable | JSX.Element | <YourCustomReactComponent /> )```

### Note:
Adding CSS is still beta, we recommend either using a css framework such as bulma css from npm or using JSX inline styles. Check the featured examples.

## Document Code with Markdown Cells
A good software engineer doesn't memorize. Instead, they know how to research. Add meaningful documentation to your code with Markdown cells so your research is done ahead of time! Hover over or below a code or text cell to add a new cell.
